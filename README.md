Atellani BRID Air Purifier driver for Hubitat

Bought the BRIDs on Kickstarter a couple years ago and have decided to try to integrate it into my Hubitat system.  Should be relatively straight-forward to install:

Add new driver code from brid.groovy
Add new virtual device, driver type "Brid Air Purifier", Device Network Id -> IP address for the BRID in standard dotted-decimal notation  (i.e. 192.168.0.23)
